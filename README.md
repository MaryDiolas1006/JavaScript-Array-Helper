# JavaScript-Array-Helper
 
 In ES6 JavaScript, you will have to learn the new array helper not for replacing the loop but to have another way to solve your codes, or to lessen  your codes and in more organized way.

### how to run ?
```node for-each-example.js```

### notes
- forEach Helper -  method calls a function once for each element in an array, in order.


- map Helper - same process with forEach but there's a return keyword the must not  forget. Whatever the function return, is placed
to new array. After each element has been processed, the new array has returned.
Map is used to modified records and some list of data and is commonly used by front end development.


- Filter Helper - is used to filter the elements that you want to see only.


- Find Helper - is to search through an array and look for a particular element in the array. It checks all the elements of the array and whichever the first element satisfies the condition is going to print.
